I'm playing around with `emscripten`. This is a dummy library which provides some kind of functionality I want abuse from JS. 

- Implementing OS functionality in JavaScript
- Calling C functions from JavaScript
- Implement kind of asynchronous disk I/O for this C library
- How to use `WebSocket` stuff instead of `socket(2)`

etc.
